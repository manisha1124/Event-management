# Event-management system
:computer:	I developed this project as a part of learning process when I was an intern. 


:point_right: 
## About the Project: 
The project is a simple event management system ideal for colleges but can also be used for any organisation or so. This system is for managing and displaying the current and past events .This system also allows the person incharge to know if the place is already booked for someother event (i.e) avoids clash of booking a place to conduct an event. An admin dashboard is also available.
